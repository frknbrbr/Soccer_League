# Soccer League Simulation

I created a Soccer League simulation program with Typescript. 
I used TSlint as a linter for statical code analysis. 
If you want to analyze my source codes you can directly go to "src" folder.

If you only want to run the program:
  -From terminal go to repos folder
  -Type "npm install"(I assume you have Node.js)
  -After that, type "npm run start" and it will run the program for you.
Sample output:
